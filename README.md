## ðŸ›  Features  
The program allows you to choose from different types of filters, such as peak, band, high-pass, low-pass and others. You can adjust the parameters of each filter, such as frequency, gain and Q. You can also choose from different filter slopes, such as 6 dB/octave, 12 dB/octave, 24 dB/octave and others.

The program allows you to use the M/S (Mid/Side) mode to process the middle and side signals separately. This allows you to control the stereo width and depth of the mix. You can also use the L/R (Left/Right) mode to process the left and right channels separately.

The program allows you to improve your workflow by grouping multiple strips together. You can move, resize, or copy groups of strips using your mouse or keyboard. You can also pause or resume recording with the ability to insert text messages.

The program has a beautiful full-screen display and a well-tuned spectrum analyzer. You can see the frequency spectrum of your track in real time and compare it with other tracks or presets. You can also change the colors and scale of the display to your liking.
